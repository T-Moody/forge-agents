        detail: |
          The swipe-to-delete indicator is rendered in `showDeleteIndicator()` in
          `list-swipe-bridge.js` (line 155). It uses a single inline SVG with
          `mud-icon-size-medium` (24x24px) inside an 80px-wide container. The CSS
          is in `list-swipe.css`. Both files are shared across all 5 list pages:
          EventsPage, RosterPage, GamesPage, ParticipantsTabContent, GamesTabContent.

          Changing the icon size (CSS or JS) affects ALL 5 pages simultaneously.
          This is a LOW-RISK change because all pages share identical swipe behavior
          and there is no per-page customization.

        detail: |
          The CreateGamePage handles two routes:
          1. `/events/{EventId}/games/add` — event-scoped game creation (has template picker)
          2. `/settings/game-templates/create` — template creation (skips template picker)

          When `IsTemplate` is true (EventId is null), `OnInitializedAsync()` skips directly to
          `FlowStep.Form` (line 157). The template picker dialog is never shown. This means
          creating a new template from settings has NO way to pre-fill from an existing template.

          The blast radius is limited to the settings game templates page only. Event-scoped
          game creation works correctly because it triggers the template picker flow.

        category: "risk"
        detail: |
          The Submit() flow in CreateGamePage (lines 352-436) calls
          GameDataService.CreateGameAsync() which creates a CreateGameCommand and sends via MediatR.
          CreateGameHandler validates dates and delegates to GameCreationService.

          GameCreationService.CreateAsync() sets `EventId = null` for templates (line 31),
          which is correct behavior. The CreateGameValidator has no template-specific validation
          rules that would reject templates.

          The error may be runtime-specific (e.g., database constraint, concurrency, or a
          MudBlazor form validation issue when no EventId is present). Static analysis cannot
          reproduce the error. Runtime debugging is needed.

          If template creation is broken, it impacts:
          - Users cannot pre-create game templates from settings
          - Event game creation still works (users can create games directly)

          If templates cannot be created:
          - The template picker in event context shows only built-in templates (Chess, Checkers, etc.)
          - Users can still create custom games directly in events
          - The GamesPage settings section shows empty library

      # Bug 3: Games tab in events — black screen + screen return
      # =========================================================================
      - id: "F-7"
        title: "Add-game black screen is the ListActionSheet overlay — affects all action sheet usages if changed globally"
        category: "blast-radius"
        detail: |
          The "black screen" is the ListActionSheet overlay with CSS class
          `.list-action-sheet-overlay` using `background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)`.
          This is EXPECTED behavior — it's a semi-transparent backdrop.

          The real bug is that the action sheet cancel navigates AWAY from the page
          rather than just closing the sheet. `OnActionSheetCancel()` (line 219) calls
          `Cancel()` which navigates to `/events/{EventId}`.

          ListActionSheet is used in:
          - CreateGamePage (bug location — used for decision sheet)
          - GamesPage (long-press context menu)
          - GamesTabContent (long-press context menu)
          - ParticipantsTabContent (add player action sheet + long-press)
          - EventsPage (long-press context menu)
          - RosterPage (long-press context menu)

          The fix should be in CreateGamePage's OnActionSheetCancel, NOT in ListActionSheet
          itself. Other pages use correct cancel behavior (just hide the sheet).

        category: "dependency"
        detail: |
          The event workflow requires games to function:
          1. Create Event → 2. Add Players → 3. Add Game → 4. Configure Scoring →
          5. Create Bracket → 6. Play Matches → 7. View Standings

          Without games, the following features are blocked:
          - Bracket creation (requires a game)
          - Match scoring (requires a bracket)
          - Standings calculation (requires completed matches)
          - Export (uses game/bracket/standings data)
          - Victory banner (checks game standings)

          EventStatusUpdater.DeriveStatusForEventAsync() returns Draft when games.Count == 0.
          The GamesTabContent shows an EmptyState with "Add Game" button that navigates to CreateGamePage.

          If the "add game" flow fails (black screen + navigate back), users cannot
          progress their event beyond players. This is a HIGH-SEVERITY blocker.

          ParticipantsTabContent uses ListActionSheet for "Add Player" with two actions:
          "Add New Player" and "Import from Roster". When cancelled, it hides the sheet
          and stays on the page — it does NOT navigate away.

          This proves the ListActionSheet component works correctly. The bug is exclusively
          in CreateGamePage's cancel handler, which conflates "dismiss action sheet" with
          "navigate away from page."

          The fix should change OnActionSheetCancel to just toggle _actionSheetVisible = false

      # Bug 3b: Skill rating should be optional

      - id: "F-10"
        title: "Skill rating change requires CreatePlayerPage, CreatePlayerCommand, IPlayerDataService, and 2 data service implementations"
        category: "blast-radius"
        detail: |
          Making skill rating optional in CreatePlayerPage requires changes across multiple layers:

          1. **UI Layer:** `CreatePlayerPage.razor.cs` — change `int _skillRating = DefaultSkillRating` to `int? _skillRating`
          2. **UI Layer:** `CreatePlayerPage.razor` — change `MudNumericField T="int"` to `T="int?"`
          3. **Command:** `CreatePlayerCommand.cs` — change `int SkillRating = DefaultSkillRating` (keep default)
          4. **Interface:** `IPlayerDataService.cs` — parameter is already `int skillRating = DefaultSkillRating`
          5. **Data Service:** `MediatorPlayerDataService.cs` — passes through, needs null-to-default coercion
          6. **Client stub:** `ClientPlayerDataService.cs` — needs matching signature
          7. **Handler/Entity:** `Player.cs` — SkillRating is `int` in entity, stays non-nullable

          The key insight: the UI field should be `int?` (empty = not provided), but the command
          default handles the null case by falling back to DefaultSkillRating (50). This means
          the command signature can remain unchanged — the UI just passes null which the default
          parameter handles. However, the current Submit() passes `_skillRating` directly to
          CreatePlayerAsync, so `int? _skillRating` with null value would need to be coerced to
          the default before passing to the service.

          The CreateRosterPlayerPage already does this correctly:
          - Uses `int? _skillRating` initialized to null
          - Passes `_skillRating ?? ValidationConstants.DefaultSkillRating` to the service

             - `Submit_PassesNicknameAndSkillRatingToService` — tests with value 75, still valid
             - Other submit tests pass `_skillRating` implicitly via the form

          2. **CreatePlayerValidatorTests.cs** — has `Validate_WithDefaultSkillRating_ShouldPass`
             which tests the command default. This test remains valid if command signature unchanged.

          3. **UpdatePlayerPage** — has its own skill rating field (pre-filled from existing player).
             This is UNAFFECTED because it loads from existing player data, not a default.

          The bug report specifically targets the Appearance page (ThemePreviewCard + AppearancePage),
          NOT a global audit. However, the same Color.Secondary pattern is used for "muted text"
          intent across the entire codebase.

          safe and isolated. A global audit would affect 33+ files across 15+ features.

          In MudBlazor, Color.Secondary on MudText applies the Secondary palette color
          (e.g., #ff4081 pink for Professional theme). The intended behavior is muted
          TextSecondary (#6E6E80 gray). The correct fix is to remove Color parameter
          and use inline Style="color: var(--mud-palette-text-secondary)" or simply

          2. **HIGH: Template creation error** — Prevents building template library. Partial
             workaround: users can create games directly in events and toggle "Save as Template."

          3. **MEDIUM: Skill rating pre-filled** — Incorrect UX but not blocking. Users can
             manually clear the field. Inconsistent with roster add page pattern.

          4. **MEDIUM: Template creation missing dropdown** — Settings-only convenience feature.
             Users can build templates through "Save as Template" toggle during event game creation.

          5. **LOW: Swipe delete icon too small** — Visual polish issue. Delete still works correctly,
             just the icon is smaller than expected in the 80px container.

          6. **LOW: Appearance colors** — Cosmetic issue on settings/appearance page. Affected only
             when viewing theme preview cards and mode label. Does not impact functionality.
        evidence:
          - "Event workflow: Create Event → Add Players → Add Game (BLOCKED) → Create Bracket → Play"
          - "EventStatusUpdater returns Draft with 0 games — event stays in limbo"
          - "All other bugs have functional workarounds"
        relevance: "Bug 3 (add game) should be fixed first as it's a workflow blocker. Other bugs are convenience/polish."

    summary: |
      Impact analysis covers 6 bug areas across 4 severity levels. The most critical bug is the
      add-game-to-event black screen/navigation issue (Bug 3), which blocks the core tournament
      workflow — events cannot progress past the players step. The swipe delete icon (Bug 1) and
      appearance colors (Bug 4) are low-risk CSS/visual-only changes with zero test breakage.
      Game template creation issues (Bug 2) affect the settings template library but have
      workarounds via event-scoped game creation. Skill rating optionality (Bug 3b) requires
      changes to CreatePlayerPage UI only — the command/handler/validator can stay unchanged
      by coercing null to the default. Total estimated test impact: 5-15 existing tests need
      updates across 3-5 test files, plus 5-10 new tests. The codebase has 99 occurrences of
      Color.Secondary on razor elements, but the bug report scopes the fix to the Appearance
      page only (2 files, 2 lines changed). Global Color.Secondary audit is out of scope.
