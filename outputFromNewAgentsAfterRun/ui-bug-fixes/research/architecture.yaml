      # Bug 1: Swipe-to-delete icon too small

        category: "structure"
        detail: |
          The swipe-to-delete icon is dynamically created in `showDeleteIndicator()` at line 155
          of `list-swipe-bridge.js`. The function creates a `<div class="swipe-delete-indicator">`
          and sets innerHTML to an inline SVG trash icon wrapped in `<span class="mud-icon-root">`.
          The SVG uses `class="mud-svg-icon mud-icon-size-medium"` — this is the MudBlazor medium
          icon size class. There is NO explicit width/height set on the SVG or the icon root span.
          A previous UX overhaul (task-06) removed the "Delete" text label from the indicator,
          leaving only the icon. After text removal, the icon may appear small because the
          indicator container (80px wide) is unchanged while the icon has no explicit sizing.

        title: "Template creation from settings goes directly to blank form — no template picker"
        category: "structure"
        detail: |
          `CreateGamePage` handles two routes:
          - `/events/{EventId:guid}/games/add` (event context) — shows template picker or action sheet
          - `/settings/game-templates/create` (template context) — goes directly to blank form

          In `OnInitializedAsync()` (lines 119-142), when `EventId` is null (template context),
          the code sets `_flowStep = FlowStep.Form` and returns. No template picker or
          "build from existing" dropdown is shown. The feature spec (FR-11) explicitly designed
          this: "template-creation route shows blank form directly (no Step 1)."

          The user's bug report says "Creating a new template is missing the dropdown that allows
          users to build from existing templates." This means the user wants template creation
          from settings to also offer the template picker. This is a feature gap, not a regression.

          The user reports "Creating a template throws an error and doesn't work anymore."
          The creation chain is:
          1. `CreateGamePage.Submit()` (lines 352-436) calls `GameDataService.CreateGameAsync()`
          2. `MediatorGameDataService.CreateGameAsync()` creates `CreateGameCommand` and sends via MediatR
          3. `CreateGameHandler.Handle()` validates scheduled dates and delegates to `GameCreationService`
          4. `GameCreationService.CreateAsync()` creates the Game entity and persists via repository

          For template context (EventId=null):
          - No scheduled date validation occurs (guard is `request.EventId.HasValue && request.ScheduledDate.HasValue`)
          - `SaveAsTemplate` logic is skipped (guard is `request.SaveAsTemplate && request.EventId.HasValue`)
          - Falls through to `repository.AddAsync(primaryGame)`

          The error may be in the validator, the handler, or a database constraint. The
          FluentValidation validator (`CreateGameValidator`) does not have rules specific to
          template-vs-event context. The Game entity has no constraints that would reject

      # Bug 3: Games tab in events — black screen / skill rating
      # =========================================================================
      - id: "F-8"
        title: "Add game from events uses ListActionSheet overlay that covers entire screen"
        category: "structure"
        detail: |
          When user taps "Add Game" in GamesTabContent, it navigates to `/events/{EventId}/games/add`
          (CreateGamePage). If custom templates exist, `OpenTemplatePickerDialog()` is called immediately
          in `OnInitializedAsync()`. If no custom templates exist, `ShowDecisionSheet()` sets
          `_actionSheetVisible = true` which renders a `ListActionSheet`.

          The ListActionSheet uses CSS: `.list-action-sheet-overlay` with `position: fixed; inset: 0;
          background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4); z-index: 1400` — this covers the ENTIRE screen with a
          semi-transparent black overlay. The `.list-action-sheet` (z-index: 1401) slides up from
          bottom.

          Bug description: "screen goes black; selecting takes back to games tab without creating."
          Two potential issues:
          1. The overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.4)) may appear fully black if backdrop rendering is broken
          2. The action sheet cancel navigates back: `OnActionSheetCancel()` calls `Cancel()` which
             does `NavigationManager.NavigateTo($"/events/{EventId}")` — returns to event detail

          If the template picker dialog is shown instead of the action sheet (custom templates exist),
          the MudDialog overlay may have similar issues. If the dialog is canceled, the code checks
          `if (!_customTemplates.Any()) { Cancel(); return; }` — navigating back.

          The "selecting takes back to games tab without creating" suggests the dialog/action sheet
          cancel handler is being triggered instead of the selection handler.

        title: "CreateGamePage action sheet cancel navigates away unconditionally"
        category: "risk"
        detail: |
          `OnActionSheetCancel()` (line 219) hides the action sheet and calls `Cancel()`.
          `Cancel()` (line 356) navigates back to `/events/{EventId}`. This means pressing
          the overlay backdrop or the cancel button on the action sheet immediately navigates
          away from CreateGamePage back to the event detail page. The user never sees the
          game creation form.

          Similarly, if the TemplatePickerDialog is canceled (result.Canceled) and custom templates
          exist, it sets `_flowStep = FlowStep.Form` and shows a blank form. But if no custom
          templates exist, it also calls `Cancel()` and navigates back.

          The memory from implementer-10 notes: "CreateGamePage.OnActionSheetCancel conflates
          'dismiss sheet' with 'navigate away' — this is a latent issue but out of scope for

        category: "pattern"
        detail: |
          Two player creation pages handle skill rating differently:
          - `CreateRosterPlayerPage` (settings roster): `private int? _skillRating;` initialized to null.
            Uses `MudNumericField` with nullable int. Skill rating is truly optional.
          - `CreatePlayerPage` (event players): `private int _skillRating = ValidationConstants.DefaultSkillRating;`
            initialized to 50. Uses `MudNumericField T="int"` (non-nullable). Skill rating is always pre-filled.

          The user says "Skill rating should be optional, not pre-filled (reference roster add page)."
          The CreatePlayerPage also uses `@bind-Value="_skillRating"` directly with a non-nullable int,
          while the roster page uses `Value="_skillRating" ValueChanged="..."` with a nullable int.

          The `CreatePlayerCommand` defines `int SkillRating = ValidationConstants.DefaultSkillRating`
          (default 50, non-nullable). Making skill rating optional in CreatePlayerPage requires
          changing the field to `int?` and updating the command/handler/validator to accept nullable.

        title: "ThemePreviewCard uses Color.Secondary for description text — renders as accent color"
        category: "pattern"
        detail: |
          In `ThemePreviewCard.razor` line 9: `<MudText Typo="Typo.body2" Color="Color.Secondary">`.
          In MudBlazor, `Color.Secondary` on MudText applies the theme's Secondary palette color
          as the text color. For the "Professional" theme, Secondary = "#ff4081" (pinkish-red).
          This means the theme description text renders in red/pink, not the muted gray that
          `TextSecondary` palette color provides.

          The correct approach for muted secondary text in MudBlazor is to either:
          1. NOT set Color at all and use CSS `color: var(--mud-palette-text-secondary)`, or
          2. Use `Style="color: var(--mud-palette-text-secondary)"`, or
          3. Use no Color parameter (MudText defaults to inherit)

          This same `Color.Secondary` misuse appears in `AppearancePage.razor` line 19 for the
          "Dark/Light" mode text.

        detail: |
          `ThemeRegistry.cs` contains 8 theme definitions, each with PaletteLight and PaletteDark.
          The Secondary color varies per theme:
          - Professional: #ff4081 (pink-red)
          - Cyber-Future: #00BCD4 (cyan)
          - Classic-Sports: varies
          - etc.

          The `ThemePreviewCard` renders 4 color swatches from `PreviewSwatches`, which include
          the Secondary color as the second swatch. The swatches correctly use `GetSwatchColor()`
          which resolves light/dark variants. The swatches themselves are fine — they're small
          colored circles showing the palette.

          The issue is specifically about text elements using `Color.Secondary` which applies
          the accent color to text instead of using the muted text color.

        title: "Color.Secondary vs TextSecondary — widespread pattern across codebase"
        category: "pattern"
        detail: |
          MudBlazor's `Color.Secondary` enum value maps to the theme's Secondary palette color
          (an accent color like pink, cyan, etc.). For muted secondary text, the theme provides
          `TextSecondary` (e.g., "#6E6E80" for Professional light mode).

          The codebase uses `Color.Secondary` on `MudText` components extensively across many pages.
          In most contexts, the intent is "muted secondary text" not "pink accent text." This is
          a systemic pattern issue, but the bug report specifically targets the Appearance page.

          Key observation: MudBlazor `MudText` with `Color="Color.Secondary"` applies
          `--mud-palette-secondary` CSS variable, while the muted text color lives in
          `--mud-palette-text-secondary`. These are different CSS variables.
        evidence:
          - "MudBlazor documentation: Color enum maps to palette accent colors"
          - "Professional theme: Secondary=#ff4081, TextSecondary=#6E6E80 (very different)"

        relevance: "The Appearance page fix should use TextSecondary instead. A broader audit may be needed but is out of scope for this bug batch."

    summary: |
      Investigated 4 bug areas across the TourneyPal architecture:

      1. **Swipe delete icon size**: The icon is rendered via inline SVG in list-swipe-bridge.js
         using MudBlazor's medium icon size (24x24px) within an 80px container. CSS has no size
         override. Fix is a single CSS or JS change affecting all 5 list pages.

      2. **Game template settings**: CreateGamePage intentionally skips template picker for
         settings route (per FR-11 spec). User wants template picker available in settings too.
         Template creation error needs runtime reproduction — code path appears structurally sound.
         TemplatePickerDialog component already exists and can be reused.

      3. **Games tab in events**: The "black screen" is the ListActionSheet overlay
         (rgba(0,0,0,0.4)). The "returns without creating" is caused by OnActionSheetCancel
         conflating dismiss with navigation away (known latent issue from previous overhaul).
         Skill rating discrepancy: CreatePlayerPage pre-fills with DefaultSkillRating (50)
         while roster uses nullable optional field.

      4. **Appearance colors**: ThemePreviewCard and AppearancePage use Color.Secondary
         on MudText, which applies the theme's accent color (#ff4081 pink for Professional)
         instead of the muted TextSecondary color. Fix is to remove Color.Secondary from
         text elements and use TextSecondary styling.
