summary: "8 bug fixes are architecturally sound. Cancel-navigation fix correctly separates dismiss from cancel. Skill rating aligns with FormFieldState pattern. ThemeRegistry preserves immutable architecture. 3 minor findings: PreviewSwatches/PaletteDark Secondary color mismatch (#FF375F vs #ff4081), inconsistent text-secondary styling (inline Style vs Color.Secondary across 30+ files), and pre-existing CreatePlayerPage guardrail gap vs CreateRosterPlayerPage."
