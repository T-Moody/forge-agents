summary: "All 8 bug fixes are security-clean. CSS var() references use MudBlazor internal theme variables from immutable static ThemeRegistry — no injection vector. Nullable skill rating has null-coalescing fallback before data submission. Navigation changes are scoped to private component state with no auth bypass. All hex theme values are compile-time string literals. No user input flows into inline styles, navigation, or data paths."
