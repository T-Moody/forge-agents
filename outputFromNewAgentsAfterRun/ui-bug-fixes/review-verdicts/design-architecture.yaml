summary: "BUG-006 theme redesign has critical spec contradiction (AC-006-8 forbids pure-black dark background but D-6 proposes #000000), two broken invariants (Surface=#FFFFFF violates Surface!=white, DrawerBackground not updated to match Surface), and missing property coupling. Other 7 bugs are architecturally sound."
