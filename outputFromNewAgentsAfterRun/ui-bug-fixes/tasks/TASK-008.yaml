  title: "Standardize semantic colors (Error/Success/Warning/Info) for 6 non-HC themes to Apple HIG"
  description: >
    Update Error, Success, Warning, Info hex values for all 6 non-high-contrast themes
    to Apple HIG standard values. Light mode: Error=#FF3B30, Success=#34C759, Warning=#FF9500,
    Info=#007AFF. Dark mode: Error=#FF453A, Success=#30D158, Warning=#FF9F0A, Info=#0A84FF.
    Each theme's Primary/Secondary/Tertiary identity colors are preserved. The high-contrast
    theme is intentionally NOT modified (WCAG AAA guidelines). Background/Surface structural
    colors for these 6 themes are NOT changed in this task.

  testing_notes: >
    Value-specific hex assertion tests will need updates for changed semantic colors.
    Invariant tests should still pass (semantic color changes don't affect Background/Surface
    invariants). Run tests incrementally — after each theme change — to isolate any failures.
    Estimated: 0-5 test assertion updates (depends on which themes have value-specific tests).
