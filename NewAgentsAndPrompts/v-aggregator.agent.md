> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** V cluster decision logic has moved to the orchestrator.
> Individual V sub-agents write isolated memory files. The orchestrator reads these memories and applies the V decision table directly.
> This file is retained for reference during migration validation.
> See `docs/feature/agent-memory-isolation/design.md` for details.
