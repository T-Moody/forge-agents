> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** CT cluster decision logic has moved to the orchestrator.
> Individual CT sub-agents write isolated memory files. The orchestrator reads these memories and applies severity-based routing directly.
> This file is retained for reference during migration validation.
> See `docs/feature/agent-memory-isolation/design.md` for details.
