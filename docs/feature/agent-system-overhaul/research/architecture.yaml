        detail: >
          Anvil is a single monolithic agent (420 lines) that handles the full development loop internally.
          Forge has 24 agent definitions: orchestrator, researcher, spec, designer, critical-thinker (deprecated),
          ct-security, ct-scalability, ct-maintainability, ct-strategy, planner, implementer, documentation-writer,
          v-build, v-tests, v-tasks, v-feature, r-security, r-quality, r-testing, r-knowledge, adversarial-reviewer,
          post-mortem, verifier, knowledge-agent. NewAgents has 9 agent definitions: orchestrator, researcher, spec,
          designer, adversarial-reviewer, planner, implementer, verifier, knowledge-agent. The root .github/agents/
          directory mirrors NewAgents exactly (9 agents + 3 reference docs). The key consolidation was replacing
          Forge's 15 specialized cluster agents (4 CT + 4 V + 4 R + documentation-writer + critical-thinker + post-mortem)
          with 2 parameterized agents (adversarial-reviewer dispatched ×3 with distinct review_focus, verifier dispatched per-task).

          Anvil uses SQL exclusively (anvil_checks table) for verification tracking and evidence gating — no
          inter-agent file communication since it's a single agent. Forge uses a dual-layer Markdown memory
          system: shared memory.md (orchestrator sole writer) plus isolated memory/<agent-name>.mem.md files
          per agent. Agents write to their isolated memory; the orchestrator reads and merges. Forge also uses
          an evaluation-schema.md for artifact feedback. NewAgents uses typed YAML schemas (10 defined in
          schemas.md with strict field definitions) for all agent outputs, with completion contracts for routing.
          It also adds two SQL databases: verification-ledger.db (anvil_checks table for verification evidence)
          and pipeline-telemetry.db (pipeline_telemetry table for execution tracking). The orchestrator reads
          ONLY typed YAML completion blocks for routing decisions, while SQL provides independent evidence gates.

        detail: >
          All three systems reference VS Code's runSubagent as the dispatch mechanism. Both Forge and NewAgents
          enforce a maximum of 4 concurrent subagent invocations per wave. When more than 4 tasks exist, they
          partition into sequential sub-waves of ≤4. Forge defines three dispatch patterns: Pattern A (fully
          parallel, ≤4 concurrent, wait for all, retry once per error), Pattern B (sequential gate + parallel),
          Pattern C (replan loop wrapping Pattern B). NewAgents defines two patterns: Pattern A (fully parallel
          with ≥M of N gate conditions varying by step) and Pattern B (sequential with replan loop, max 3
          iterations). The Forge orchestrator prompt says 'Dispatch independent agents in parallel — invoke
          each subagent as a separate runSubagent call concurrently in parallel'. However, the actual concurrency
          is platform-dependent — whether VS Code truly runs multiple runSubagent calls in parallel or serializes
          them is determined by the runtime. The Forge feature-workflow prompt also instructs: 'Dispatch
          independent agents in parallel'. Anvil does not use explicit parallel dispatch for its main workflow
          but dispatches 3-4 code-review subagents in parallel for adversarial review of Large tasks.

          not a custom .agent.md definition. NewAgents uses a custom adversarial-reviewer.agent.md dispatched as
          3 parallel instances with model as an orchestrator-provided parameter. The design.md explicitly states:
          'The ability to route subagent dispatches to specific LLM models via .agent.md configuration is
          UNVERIFIED at time of design. No documentation or prior implementation confirms that VS Code's

          dispatch 3 reviewers with the SAME model but distinct review_focus parameters (security, architecture,
          correctness). Forge's approach avoids this problem entirely by using different specialized agent
          definitions (4 CT agents, 4 R agents) rather than model routing. All Forge agents include

          NewAgents introduces explicit approval gates at Step 1a (post-research) and Step 4a (post-planning).
          These use structured YAML templates with gate_id, question, context, and multiple-choice options
          presented via ask_questions. In interactive mode, the orchestrator pauses and waits for human response.
          In autonomous mode, the default option is auto-selected. Forge has a simpler approach: if
          APPROVAL_MODE is true, pause for approval after Steps 1.1 and 4; if false, skip. Forge does not
          define the approval interaction format. Anvil has pushback with ask_user providing freeform choices
          ('Proceed as requested' / 'Do it your way instead' / 'Let me rethink this') but no structured gates.
          NewAgents also supports the APPROVAL_MODE variable via the feature-workflow prompt, defaulting to
          autonomous mode.

          - "NewAgents/.github/prompts/feature-workflow.prompt.md — APPROVAL_MODE variable"
        relevance: "Structured approval gates enable human-in-the-loop oversight for high-risk changes. The overhaul should decide the right level of interaction design for approval points."

    summary: >
      Three agent systems exist with fundamentally different architectures: Anvil is a monolithic single agent
      using SQL verification; Forge is a 24-agent pipeline with Markdown memory files and prose-based routing;
      NewAgents is a 9-agent pipeline with typed YAML schemas and SQL evidence gates. The key architectural
      evolution from Forge to NewAgents was: (1) consolidating 15 specialized cluster agents into 2
      parameterized agents, (2) replacing prose memory files with typed YAML completion contracts for routing,
      (3) adopting Anvil's SQL evidence gating pattern for anti-hallucination verification, (4) adding
      pipeline state recovery (EC-5), and (5) allowing the orchestrator run_in_terminal for SQL queries (DR-1).
      The critical unverified assumption across ALL systems is whether VS Code's runSubagent API supports model
      routing for multi-model adversarial review — no evidence confirms this capability works for custom agents.
      The root .github/agents/ currently mirrors NewAgents' 9-agent structure.
