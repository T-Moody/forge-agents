summary: "schemas.md Schema 9 not updated for perspective-based review: uses old reviewer_model/review_focus fields, wrong perspective names (architecture-purist/correctness-checker), and incompatible check_name convention. Routing matrix inconsistency for Designer. All 4 major+ findings in schemas.md — single-file fix."
