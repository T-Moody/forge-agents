summary: "Round 2 re-review confirms all R1 security findings were appropriately deferred. SEC-1 (unenforced sql_escape) and SEC-2 (shell pattern docs) are non-blocking given pipeline-internal values and PowerShell environment. SEC-3 and SEC-4 are Minor defense-in-depth items. R1 fixes introduced no new security issues. All deferred findings genuinely non-blocking."
