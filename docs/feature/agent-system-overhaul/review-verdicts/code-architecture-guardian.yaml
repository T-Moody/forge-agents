summary: "schemas.md has grown to 1528 lines spanning 6+ concern domains beyond YAML schemas, including DDL that conflicts with canonical sql-templates.md §1 (missing instance column, nullability differences, status enum divergence). Evidence gate queries in schemas.md use LIKE-based counting logic incompatible with the 3-INSERT-per-reviewer pattern. Recommend extracting non-schema content and removing duplicate DDL to restore single-source-of-truth discipline."
