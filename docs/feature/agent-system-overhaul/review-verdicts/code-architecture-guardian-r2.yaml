summary: "All 4 Major R1 findings resolved. ARCH-1 (DDL dual source) and ARCH-3 (LIKE evidence gates) extracted to sql-templates.md pointers. CORR-1 (column conflicts) synced. CORR-2 (cross-ref drift) fixed. ARCH-2 scope reduction intentionally deferred — dangerous content removed, lower-risk governance content remains as documented tech debt. 1 Minor residual observation."
