    title: "Add Frontmatter to severity-taxonomy.md"
    description: |
      Add YAML frontmatter to NewAgents/.github/agents/severity-taxonomy.md for VS Code
      discovery consistency (FR-16). This is a minimal change — add frontmatter block at
      the top of the existing file.

      Add:
      ```
      ---
      name: "severity-taxonomy"
      description: "Unified severity definitions for all adversarial review and verification findings"
      ---
      ```

      No other content changes required.
