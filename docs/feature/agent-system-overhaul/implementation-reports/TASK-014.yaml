          Restructured verifier agent from 524 lines to 317 lines.
          Added YAML frontmatter (name, description).
          Extracted inline SQL INSERT templates → reference sql-templates.md §2, §0, §1.
          Extracted inline check_name convention → kept quick reference table, detailed docs in sql-templates.md §6.
          Extracted inline error handling/retry rules → reference global-operating-rules.md §1–§2.
          Extracted common self-verification items → reference global-operating-rules.md §6.
          Extracted inline tool access table → reference tool-access-matrix.md §8.
          Removed all inline SQL INSERT examples (6 examples, ~55 lines).
          Removed inline Safety Net Initialization DDL → reference sql-templates.md §1.
          Granted create_file with scope restriction (verification-reports/*.yaml only) — resolves FR-11.
          Added artifact evaluation INSERT instruction after reading implementation report — FR-5.
          Tier 2 cascade explicitly requires run_in_terminal with CLI commands — FR-7 (AC-7.2).
          get_errors restricted to Tier 1 compile-time diagnostics only.
          Updated Anti-Drift Anchor to reference create_file scope restriction.
