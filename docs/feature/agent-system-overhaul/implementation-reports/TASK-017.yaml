          Restructured designer agent: updated frontmatter description, replaced
          revision mode single-file input (review-verdicts/design.yaml) with
          glob-based per-perspective discovery (review-verdicts/design-*.yaml via
          list_dir), extracted inline tool access table to tool-access-matrix.md §5
          reference, added shared doc references to global-operating-rules.md §1-§3,
          §5, §6, compacted companion output section, reduced from 280 to 265 lines.
          Pre-existing broken anchor link (#companion-output-designmd) resolved as
          side effect of section consolidation.
