        description: >
          Restructured from 522 to 334 lines. Added YAML frontmatter (name, description).
          Extracted inline tool access table to tool-access-matrix.md §7 reference.
          Extracted inline SQL INSERT templates to sql-templates.md §2 reference.
          Extracted error handling/retry rules to global-operating-rules.md §1-§2 reference.
          Removed inline no-file-redirect rule (now in .github/copilot-instructions.md global).
          Extracted common self-verification items to global-operating-rules.md §6 reference.
          Added artifact evaluation INSERT step (FR-5) after reading task file, referencing
          evaluation-schema.md §3-§4 and sql-templates.md §4.
          Added Context7 conditional reference to context7-integration.md.
          Added severity-taxonomy.md reference for security findings.
          Added terminal-only testing callout in self-fix loop (FR-7, AC-7.3).
          Enforced SQL safety via stdin piping references to sql-templates.md §0.
          Compacted YAML output structure, operating rules, TDD fallback, baseline capture,
          revert mode, and documentation mode sections.
          Retained: TDD workflow, self-fix loop (max 2), git add -A, anti-drift anchor,
          role-specific self-verification, implementation report output schema.
