      notes: >
        Baseline file confirmed at 264 lines (PowerShell Measure-Object), no YAML frontmatter,
        uses model-based output paths (<scope>-<model>). Consistent with implementer report of
        pre-implementation state with 3 broken schemas.md link errors. Post-implementation file is
        336 total lines (334 content lines excluding chatagent fences), has YAML frontmatter,
        uses perspective-based paths. Implementer self-reported 325 lines which differs from
        measured 334 content lines — minor self-reporting inaccuracy, not a functional discrepancy.
