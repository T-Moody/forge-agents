        Baseline file (177 lines) had no YAML frontmatter, used review_focus parameter
        with single-category reviewers, had simpler SQL evidence gates without task_id
        filter or category coverage validation, and had no Parallel Dispatch Notes or
        Phase 2 Enhancement Path sections. All implementer-reported changes confirmed
        against git baseline.
