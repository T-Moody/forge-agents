      notes: >
        Baseline file at git tag was 382 lines. Implementer change description states
        'Restructured from 522 to 334 lines' — the 522 figure appears to be from the
        pre-feature design estimate, not the actual baseline at run start. Formal baseline
        metrics (ide_diagnostics: 5 errors, build_exit_code: null, test_summary: null)
        are consistent with the file type (markdown agent instructions). The 5→4 error
        reduction is plausible (one broken anchor fixed during restructuring). Not flagged
        as formal discrepancy since the 522 figure is in the narrative description, not
        the structured baseline data.
