    notes:
      - >
        Implementation report describes change as '524→317 lines' but git baseline tag shows 389 lines
        (not 524). The 524 figure appears to originate from the planner's pre-pipeline estimate. This
        is a description-level inaccuracy in the change summary, not a baseline verification field
        discrepancy. Structured baseline fields (ide_diagnostics.errors: 3) cannot be independently
        verified via git show.
      - >
        Tool access summary line claims '9 tools allowed' but only 8 are listed. Minor count
        discrepancy also present in tool-access-matrix.md §8. Not blocking.
      - >
        get_errors is correctly restricted to Tier 1 compile-time diagnostics only (lines 175, 267).
      - >
